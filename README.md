# Clean Architecture app

This is a little demo app showcasing the clean architecture. My goal is to keep building on this app in order to explore new parts of the CA.

Hope you like it.

#Usage:

1. To start db instance: 
```
docker-compose up --build -d
```

2. To start dev server:
```
npm run dev
```

To send some sample requests, run some of the requests from ```test-requests.http```
